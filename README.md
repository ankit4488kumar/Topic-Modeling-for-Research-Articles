Topic Modeling for Research Articles 
Researchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process. 

Given the abstract and titles for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set. 
Note that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topics. The research article abstracts are sourced from the following 6 topics: 

1. Computer Science

2. Mathematics

3. Physics

4. Statistics

5. Quantitative Biology

6. Quantitative Finance
